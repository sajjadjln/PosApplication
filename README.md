# PosApplication

this project contains two applications
1. password generating application
2. pos application

## PosPassword
at first you should use the password app to generate a random six digit number for yourself and use that in the pos application.
you can also create new cards in this app. the information of the cards will be stored in a file so you can use the saved cards option in the other application.

you can choose which saved card you want to generate password for. this option is still on development so it does not really care for which card you choose and generates a general password that you can use for all the cards.the passwords will also be stored in a file.

## PosMain
now you can open the pos application.
you will enter your desire amount of money and then choose to use a saved card or enter new information.
in this process your card information will be checked.
if everything goes fine, your transaction will be succeed and it will be saved in a file and in the end app gonna ask you if you want to save card information or not.
if you hit 1 then card info will be saved in the same card file.
